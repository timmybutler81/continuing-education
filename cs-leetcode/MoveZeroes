Attempted to solve without changing the array in place
This helped me understand a two pointer solution
In the commented code, I ran test examples to make sure my code was functioning correctly

class Solution {
    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        /**
        Try with making a new array first
        [0,1,0,3,12]
           ^
         ^
        right = 0
        left = 0
         */

        int left = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
            if (nums[right] != 0) {
                int temp = nums[right];
                nums[right] = nums[left];
                nums[left] = temp;
                left++;
            }
        }
    }
}
